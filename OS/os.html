      <h1>Operating System</h1>
      
      <p>An OS is a suite of programs that control how the resources of the computer are managed such as the RAM and processor time, to maximise the performance of the computer. There are different types of OSs however the most common ones are Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux.</p>
      
      <p>Microsoft Windows being the cheapest and easiest to use OS makes it the most popular OS. Windows is also the first OS majority of the people learn to use as it requires no outside knowledge of computers. MacOS offers a more visual display and is therefore more expensive.<br><br> Finally, Linux is an open source OS and isn't as graphical compared to Windows or macOS. However, for many programmers linux is their first choice as it provides more control over the OS that windows cannot by allowing the user to change the source code of the OS, making linux more customizable.</p>

      <h1>Applications</h1>
      <p>An application is a program that runs on a device. There are many different types of applications, some having a more specific use than others. A general purpose application is one that can be used in multiple different instances. An example of this is Microsoft Word which can be used to write an essay, book or even create a poster. There are also more specialised software’s such as Sage. Sage is specialised software that is used by companies for accounting purposes and managing financial information. <br><br> Some applications are not portable meaning that they only work on a specific type of processors. This could be a program written explicitly for a specific purpose and may be written using a LLL. An example of this could be writing code for a robot arm to move items from one place to another. The program for this would be written using a LLL like assembly and will be device specific. This means this program cannot run on a home computer as it does not meet the hardware requirements to run the program. Another example of this could be a game for a gaming console. Gaming consoles have very specific hardware architectures and they are optimised to run games which require a lot of processing power. These games cannot be run on a home computer as the processors for home computers are not optimised for these tasks. However a gaming computer may be used to run this application as it has the appropriate hardware devices for this task.</p>
